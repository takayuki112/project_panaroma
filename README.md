This project aims stitch multiple images together to create a panorama. The project is implemented in Python using OpenCV library. Following are the important files and their description:

1. project_panaroma.py: This fiel contains the implementation of the Stitcher Class which contains methods for all the steps involved in creating a panorama.
2. stitcher_config.yaml: This file contains the configuration for the stitcher class. 
3. image_stitching.ipynb: This is the main implementation pipeline that walks through all the steps of stitching.
4. lab_demo.ipynb and stitching_examples.ipynb: These files contain the demo of the project and some examples of stitching images.

5. recommendations.py: This file contains the implementation of the Recommendations class which contains methods for recommending images to stitch together.

6. reccomendations.ipynb: This file contains the implementation pipeline for the Recommendations class.
